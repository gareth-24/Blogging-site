  <h3>Starting Pitcher: Logan Gilbert</h3>
  <p> Logan Gilbert took to the mound in his final outing of this spring. He stuggled with command out of the gate allowing a run on a walk, stolen base, and single in the top of the first. However, he found his footing and shut out the Royals over the next two frames.</p>
